This project focuses on the cybersecurity of hydrogen infrastructure within the scope of the HI-ACT (Hydrogen Integration for Accelerated Energy Transitions) programme. It explores attack surfaces, risk mitigation strategies, and digital twin implementations for enhanced situational awareness and resilience.


The project investigates cybersecurity challenges that arise in hydrogen systems, focusing on real-time monitoring, data integrity, and threat modeling. Special attention is given to cyber-physical attack vectors such as data injection, relay configuration attacks, and denial of service (DoS) scenarios targeting supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems.
