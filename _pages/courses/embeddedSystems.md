## Course Overview
This course provides an in-depth exploration of embedded systems programming using the ARM
 STM32 microcontroller platform. Students will learn the fundamental concepts of embedded
 systems, gain hands-on experience with STM32 microcontrollers, and develop proficiency in
 register-based programming. The course also covers topics related to interfacing peripherals,
 real-time operating systems, and debugging techniques commonly used in embedded systems
 development.



Description	Topics include Embedded Systems,
 ARM Cortex Architecture, ARM Assembly Language,
 ARM C Programming, Memory Mapping & Debugging,
 Interrupts and Exceptions, Timers, Peripherals
 , A/D & D/A Conversions, and Communication Protocols.

## Prerequisites
1. Basic understanding of digital electronics.
2. Familiarity with C/C++ programming.

## Recommended Textbooks
