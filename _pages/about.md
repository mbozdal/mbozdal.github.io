I am a Research Fellow at the University of Birmingham, engaged in the HI ACT: Hydrogen Integration for Accelerated Energy Transitions project, and an Assistant Professor at Abdullah Gül University. My research interests include in-vehicle communication, cyber-physical systems security, embedded systems, and the internet of things. Additionally, I have a curiosity about precision farming. I teach courses that are related to embedded systems and programming.

I completed my postgraduate studies with a scholarship from the Turkish Ministry of Education. I earned my Ph.D. in 2022 from Cranfield University, where I focused on the security of in-vehicle CAN communication. Before that, I completed my MSc in Embedded Systems Engineering from the University of Leeds with distinction in 2016 and my bachelor's degree in Electrical and Electronics Engineering from Çukurova University in 2013.
